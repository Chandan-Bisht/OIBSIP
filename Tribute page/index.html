        <p>
          Born in 1887, Ramanujan’s life, as said by Sri Aurobindo, was a
          <q>rags to mathematical riches</q> life story. His geniuses of the
          20th century are still giving shape to 21st-century mathematics.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Srinivasa Ramanujan was
            <strong>born on 22nd December 1887</strong> in the south Indian town
            of Tamil Nadu, named Erode.
          </li>
          <li>
            His <strong>father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar</strong> worked as
            a clerk in a saree shop and his
            <strong>mother, Komalatamma</strong> was a housewife.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since a very early age, he had a keen interest in mathematics and
            had already become a child prodigy.

        </ul>
        <p class="sub-section">
          <em>Achievements &#8212;</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the age of 12, he had completely read Loney’s book on Plane
            Trignometry and A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied
            Mathematics, which were way beyond the standard of a high school
            student.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In 1916</strong>
            , he was
            <strong>
              granted a Bachelor of Science degree
              <q>by research</q>
              at the Cambridge University </strong
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In 1918</strong>
            , he became the first Indian to be honoured as a
            <strong>Fellow of the Royal Society</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1997,
            <strong><em>The Ramanujan Journal</em></strong>
            was launched to publish work
            <q>in areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan</q>.

              Year</strong

            as it marked the 125th birth year of one of the greatest Indian
            mathematicians.

            Since 2023, his birth anniversary,
            <strong
